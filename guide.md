Here are the things that I want to focus on.

[] Implement CSS variables for repetitive things (Research if you have to)
  - Usually colors, font-sizes, backgrounds.

[] Focus on making this survey. Do not focus on responsiveness just yet.

[] Use no fixed units, ems, rems, and percentages.

[] Use a CSS Reset.

[] Take notes on Lessons Learned.

[] Take as much time as you have to. The goal is to learn, not to compete.
